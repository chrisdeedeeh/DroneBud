# DroneBud
DroneBud is a simple flight controller for use with the Arduino Due. It's easy to understand, and easy to edit for custom applications. We encourage you to use it for your next drone project.

You'll need to edit PID gains while using DroneBud. There are many online tutorials surrounding the subject, but make sure to find one that involves tuning from scratch.
