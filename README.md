# DroneBud
DroneBud is a simple flight controller for use with the Arduino Due. It's easy to understand, and easy to edit for custom applications. We encourage you to use it for your next drone project.

DroneBud isn't meant to be the fastest, lightest, or best flight controller. It's meant to be easy to understand and read the code, so that it can be tailored to your needs. When a library can be used, it is used in the DroneBud code.

Major libraries used include the arduino PID library, MPU tockn, and Servo.

Altitude and position hold modes coming soon.

You'll need to edit PID gains while using DroneBud. There are many online tutorials surrounding the subject, but make sure to find one that involves tuning from scratch.
